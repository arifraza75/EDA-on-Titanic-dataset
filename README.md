# EDA OF TITANIC PASSENGER SURVIVAL

## Summary:
This analysis examines the factors affecting passenger survival on the Titanic. We explore attributes like age, gender, and family size to identify patterns. Key findings show that women and older passengers had higher survival rates compared to younger men. We also look at the impact of traveling alone versus with family. Visualizations and summaries provide a clear understanding of the main factors influencing survival.

## Key Features of the Titanic Dataset:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
Name: Name of the passenger.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Objectives:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Exploration & Visualization
3. Feature Engineering

## Key insights:
- Around 38% of total passengers survived.
- Most passengers were in the age group of 30 to 40 years.
- Most of the passengers traveled at a lower cost ticket, as the majority of them were in the 3rd class.
- There are 3 embarkation points, & most of the passengers embarked from the 'S' point.
- The passengers who were traveling with family had a higher survival rate compared to those who were traveling alone.
- Also the rate of survival for women and older people is higher compared to younger men.
- Travelling in Pclass 3 was deadliest.
